                    <h2>Best Practices For Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows </h2>
                    <p>
                        In the article "Best Practices For Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows" by Naema Baskanderi, I learned a lot of 
                    useful information on Modals such as the benefits and diasdvantages of using modals and what to consider when making a modal.
                    Before when I would think about modals, I always saw them as an annoying pop up window that I immediately closed. I
                learned throughout this article that it is not only me who feels this way but many other users also dread modals since they 
                interrupt user flow and make it impossible to interact with the parent page by hiding content behind the modal.</p> 
                        
                    <p> However, I also learned that there are surprisingly many advantages to having modals. For example, getting user's 
                        attention, keeping context and simplifying the UI. These advantages of modals, in my opinion, seem to outweigh
                    the diasdvantages listed in the previous paragraph. Whenever, I am faced with a modal I always see it as a bad thing
                but through this article I have learned that I should also consider the reason as to why it is being used!</p>
                        
                    <p>Furthermore, Baskanderi goes on to explain the anatomy of a modal window. She lists how there must be an escape hatch
                        that allows users to close the modal (ex: cancel button), a descriptive title, buttons that have actionable, 
                        understandable names, a modal window that isn't to big or small, and finally that the modal should be user 
                        initiated such as clicking a button that triggers the modal. I especially agree with the last point because I have
                    come across many modals that surprise me when they pop up so I immediately close them without looking at the context.
                    Overall, this article was very informative and gave me a new perspective on modals!

                    <h2>Best Practices For Form Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the article "Best practices for form design" by Salim Ansari, I learned so many useful tips on how to boost 
                        form usability. As a computer science major, I have to code many of these forms when I am creating 
                        projects but I always fail to consider how to style these forms to achieve the best UX. While reading
                        this article, it opened my eyes to many ways to improve the way I style these form fields.</p> 
                        
                    <p>For example, one common mistake I make when creating form fields is always keeping all the asterisks there for
                        required fields. I learned through this article that instead of doing this, one can just label the
                        optional field and remove the asterisks off of the required fields. Another important tip is to 
                        size fields accordingly! When I code form fields, I usually make all the form fields the same size. 
                        I didn't realize that is it recommended to make a a shorter form field for zip code and a longer form 
                        field for something that needs a longer input like one's city. Another interesting point I noticed 
                        in the article was to minimize the drop down menus. Before, I had thought that drop down menus were 
                        the way to go as the most effective way to display answer choices. After reading this article, it makes 
                        more sense as to why radio buttons are preferred for when there are a large amount of answer choices. From my perspective,
                        I do now realize how drop down menus can make scanning much more difficult. </p>
                        
                    <p>Lastly, I can also relate to some of these explanations of the do's and don't because I can recall so many times in which
                        I click the reset button instead of the submit button. It makes me less inclined to fill the form in 
                        again since all my progress has been deleted. Overall, this article is extremely useful and has shown me a 
                        different perspective on the processes of styling form fields!</p>

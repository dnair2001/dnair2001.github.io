                  <h2>Best Practices For Form Design</h2>
                  <p>
                    In the article "Best practices for form design" by Salim Ansari, I learned so many useful tips on how to boost 
                    form usability. As a computer science major, I have to code many of these forms when I am creating 
                    projects but I always fail to consider how to style these forms to achieve the best UX. While reading
                    this article, it opened my eyes to many ways to improve the way I style these form fields. For example,
                    one common mistake I make when creating form fields is always keeping all the asterisks there for
                    required fields. I learned through this article that instead of doing this, one can just label the
                    optional field and remove the asterisks off of the required fields. Another important tip is to 
                    size fields accordingly! When I code form fields, I usually make all the form fields the same size. 
                    I didn't realize that is it recommended to make a a shorter form field for zip code and a longer form 
                    field for something that needs a longer input like one's city. Another interesting point I noticed 
                    in the article was to minimize the drop down menus. Before, I had thought that drop down menus were 
                    the way to go as the most effective way to display answer choices. After reading this article, it makes 
                    more sense as to why radio buttons are preferred for when there are a large amount of answer choices. From my perspective,
                    I do now realize how drop down menus can make scanning much more difficult. Lastly, 
                    I can also relate to some of these explanations of the do's and don't because I can recall so many times in which
                    I click the reset button instead of the submit button. It makes me less inclined to fill the form in 
                    again since all my progress has been deleted. Overall, this article is extremely useful and has shown me a 
                    different perspective on the processes of styling form fields!

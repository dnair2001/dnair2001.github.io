                    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                    <p>This project is about my mischievous 7-month old puppy named Benji. I want to create a journey-like Experience
                        for people to travel through in which they can click on hotspots to have an overlay popup.

                    <p class="imgText"> This site is very fun and has such a cute interface! I always used to play Super Mario Bros when I was younger
                        so it helped inspire my project. I like how when mario travels, he stops at a hotspot in order to go into the next level and 
                        recieve his clue. It is really cool how the hotspot changes color once he is done completing that level. My ony complaint about 
                        this site is that Mario is traveling sideways so it doesn't really look as great on a website but works perfectly on a gaming device.

                    </figure>
                    <p class="imgText"> This site is really cool because it is like an online scavenger hunt almost. We are presented with a clue
                        and then we must use the map in order to figure out the answer to that clue and be able to locate it on the map. Overall,
                        I think this idea for the website is super unique and those clues that show up that direct us to the next task remind me of
                        what I want to implement on my website. However, on my website I would be using overlays instead of the "clues" to guide people
                        onto the next step. My only complaint about this website is that it is a bit hard to navigate for first time users. When I played
                        it for the first time, I was very confused on how to go about the game. I will make sure I make the user experience great for
                        my site by providing clear instructions on how to play. I also this the User interface for this website can have cuter graphics to
                        make it more visually appealing</p>

                    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
                    <p>It is similar to Comparison Project 1 because there will be hotspots for each location we have to travel to similar to how
                        Mario has a hotspot at each level. Instead of traveling sideways like Mario, I will be scrolling down. I want to take the 
                        user through a journey of Benji's day and allow them to interact with the page. I wil use overlays to display images and pictures.
                        For my studio 2 project, I didn't have a scrolling interface or hotspots so I want to upgrade this Every Picturw Project to incorporate
                        those ideas.

                    <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
                    <p>For the background color I will be sticking with the antiquewhite color because it is tan and looks like the same
                        color as an old map. I also used maroon for the text because I notice many maps have maroon seals or other types of
                        maroon elements. These colors also work well together and aren't too flashy either. For the title, I will use a font 
                        called Sacramento. It is a cursive style font but it is very bold and fancy at the same time making it one of my 
                        favorite fonts!

                    <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
                    <p>When a user clicks on a hotspot, an overlay will pop up on the screen showing what benji was doign at the time of day and
                        will give a small description of the video/image as well as where he will go next. I also plan to keep the same
                        mouseover interactions from last time in which when I mouse over a specific location, a small image pops up. On the
                        very last hotspot, there will be a label indicating that Benji is lost and we must find him! The user will click on this text
                        and it will take us to the next page in which I will have a time based slideshow on pictures of Benji.

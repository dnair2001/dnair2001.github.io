        <p class="ob shadow">One main observation that the user made during our User Test Session was that my game doesn't indicate to the user that it has finished. It abruptly stops and the user is left to wonder why the pigs have stopped moving until he/she looks and notices that the timer is at 0. Some suggestions from the user included having an overlay that shows saying "Time's Up! You have scored [your score] points!" Then a play again or quit button would show below it as well. Another suggestion was to also include a timer buzzer that happens once the timer hits zero. This will allow the user to know time is up without having to look at the clock. For my final project, I will add both an overlay and a timer buzz sound to indicate that the game is over.</p>

        <p class="ob shadow">Another main observation that the user made during our User Test Session was that the timer for my game has a bug. During the first time someone plays the game, the timer has no gitches and works fine. However, when the user presses start again, the timer doesn't reset properly and instead keeps flashing 0:00 at every second. This distracted the user because it kept shifting the title back and forth so it gave them a bad user experience. I wasn't able to notice this bug until I actually had a user test out my code! For my final project, I will try to find the bug in my code and fix it so that there is no glitch the second time a user plays my game. Or, another idea is that I can have a "Return Home" button again so that the page can refresh (which resets the timer) after the user completes one round. </p>

        <p class="ob shadow">One last observation that the user made during our User Test Session was that the placement of my timer was awkward as well. It was in the same line as the title and the score so users felt that there was too much going on on one line. In other words, it looked too busy. Users suggested to make the timer in a new line under the first line which was the title and the score. Another place they thought that the timer would look good in would be where the start button is. Once a user clicks start, the start button would disappear and the timer would reappear in the same place. One last suggestion regarding the timers was to change the font size and the font family to separate itself from the title. For my final project, I will take all of these ideas into account but I am leaning otwards putting the timer on a separate line underneath the title and score. I am considering changing it's font into a sans serif font to create more of a distinction and separate it from the title.</p>

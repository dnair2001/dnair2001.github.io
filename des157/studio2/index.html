            <p> At the crack of dawn, we took Benji out for his morning walk on a hilly trail! He enjoyed his 
                time there and met lots of friendly dogs. He ran up the hills so fast that even I couldn't 
                keep up. Even after this morning walk, Benji was still not tired!

            <p> After his first morning walk, he still was not tired so we took him for another walk around our neighbourhood.
                He ran at the speed of lightning! Wow!! He is a puppy so he has a lot of energy!

            <p> When we came back home, Benji took a nap for a couple of hours. When he woke up, he was fully energized and ready to
                go out again. When Benji heard that he was going to meet up with his friend Ginnie, he ran so fast up the stairs
                all the way to Ginnie's house. There, they had a play date.

            <p> After the play date at Ginnie's house, we threw a party at our house and dressed up Benji. He wore
                something that my mom had knitted for him as well as a party hat!

            <p> Lastly, we took Benji to our neighbourhood park and played fetch and other fun games with him.
                We were there for a couple of hours and got super tired so we decided to go back home. We
                were so tired that we didn't even bother to check if Benji had gotten in the car with us!
                Oh no! Benji must be at the park!
